## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this solution i worked with grid property and i would say it wasn't easy enough to figure out. One of the card is taller than others etc. First time ever i used grid properties and i kinda learn it. Like everything, grid needs practice.
